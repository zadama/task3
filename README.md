# Task 3 - RPG Characters

An assignment as part of a course at Experis Academy, by Noroff. A short description of what is required and objectives: What you are required to do is model and demonstrate a simple RPG character
system. No game logic is required aside from the aspects explicitly mentioned in
req document. This Task is designed to test modelling and class design skills. 

## Installation

Download to the project either by Zip or the terminal, if the latter choice:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/zadama/task3.git
```

## Usage

Open the project in your preferred IDE: Intellij, Eclipse etc. This is the best and recommended option as
you will find it easier to debug and add/remvove functionality. However, if you want to run the program
directly in the terminal then navigate to "task3\out\production\task3\se\experis\com\aman" and run "java Main"
